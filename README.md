# scoop-minorgod [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/r0bbdnvk15t1vnps?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/lukesampson/scoop-extras)

The "minorgod" bucket for [Scoop](http://scoop.sh), for some random apps I wanted to manage through scoop. 

To make it easy to install apps from this bucket, run
    `scoop bucket add minorgod https://github.com/minorgod/scoop-minorgod.git`
